# Inventory Management System - Java Swing

This project was born as a work for the completion of the java cycle in MisionTic 2022, with dedication and effort given the complexity of java swing, I managed to make a great GUI that together with a backend made with spring boot and a database in mysql, comply fully its objective, the control and administration of the inventory in this case of a supermarket but with scalability to other needs and scenarios. This GUI was made entirely with code, which allowed me to deepen my knowledge of java swing.
